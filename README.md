# BMW 507 – 3D Scroll Experience

A minimal front-end experiment that recreates the famous “Mustang Boom” scrolling effect, this time featuring the classic **BMW 507**.  

The goal of this project is simple:  
**Show what’s possible with modern scroll-based 3D interaction on the web** – no extra pages, no dashboard, just one strong landing experience.

## ✨ What This Project Shows

- Smooth, cinematic **scroll-based animation**
- 3D-style presentation of the **BMW 507**
- Focus on **one hero section** – no complex site, just a concept
- Perfect as a **showcase for clients** who want something more than a basic template site
